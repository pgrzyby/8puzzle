The 8-puzzle game is a sliding puzzle that consists of a frame of numbered square tiles in random order with one tile missing.

This program creates and solves a 3x3 8-puzzle game using several different algorithms: Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search, Uniform-Cost Search
Greedy First Search, and A* search with two different heuristics.
